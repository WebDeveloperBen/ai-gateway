- [x] on /Applications/<app_id> give the settings button something to do (maybe open the modal to edit the page)
- [x] make component from /users/overview/stats cards for a second flavour (undecided which is better)
- [x] add ability to edit a user (likely just a modal for now, but eventually an internal page)
- [x] add confirmation modal to deactivate a user
- [x] add confirmation modal to delete a user
- [ ] add functionality of roles to enable ACL's
- [ ] add functionality for teams / grouping of individuals with the intentional to be able to share ACL's easily (Can be a later thing)
